				<h1 style="color:white;margin-top:24px;">Hello, I'm Cowrod!</h1>
				<p>Not so long ago I decided to rebuild this website, but it will be back soon.<br>
				Also now all of the APIs hosted on this website WILL be down, as they need refreshment etc. etc.</p>
				<p>Lastly, I am hosting <a href="https://github.com/redlib-org/redlib#redlib">Redlib</a> again. (Alternative private front-end to Reddit)<br>
				You can use the instance <a href="https://redlib.cow.rip">here</a>. Though it is a bit slow due to the fact that it goes through a double proxy.</p>

				<hr/>
				<h3>update logs:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>[16/12/2025] Redlib down time yet again.
						<ul>
							<li>The magic actually did well for a few days until it didn't, the proxy settings apperantly were half-working now it is running as expected, also few other things:</li>
							<li>Now instead of Cloudflare the site is using <a href="https://anubis.techaro.lol/">Anubis</a>,</li>
							<li>And I have only tested 3 proxies on the server so far for connecting to reddit (all spinning like a fidget spinner ofc) and so far 1st seems to broke SSL, 2nd is the best, 3rd (current) stable for the long term</li>
							<li>Those proxies might change later but as of now I'll let the 3rd one be and see how it stands.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>[08/12/2025] *2 Everything is back up.
						<ul>
							<li>Through magic, everything is back up! And no it is not the same hosting it just goes fully through Cloudflare now. (So it is only 2 proxies but slower than before.)</li>
							<li>Also for protection the bot protection by Cloudflare is active.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>[08/12/2025] Everything had a downtime.
						<ul>
							<li>Bandwith limit, the site is back via Github pages, however redlib isn't just yet. I'll have to add some protection against bots so redlib will be down for a bit.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>[05/12/2025] Redlib instance got downtime yet again, this time it wasn't the proxies! (Right now the instance seems fine however I don't know for how long.)
						<ul>
							<li>For more information checking these issues listed on github can help <a href="https://github.com/redlib-org/redlib/issues/446">#446</a> (&lt; read this one in specific for more info), <a href="https://github.com/redlib-org/redlib/issues/488">#488</a>, <a href="https://github.com/redlib-org/redlib/issues/511">#511</a></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>[01/12/2025] Redlib instance got some downtime but it has been resolved by;
						<ul>
							<li>Adding yet another proxy to the mix, and this one rotates. Literally! (The proxy counter: 4.)</li>
						</ul>
